# Create a Dockerfile that installs Python, sets up a virtual environment, and runs a Flask app.
# Use an official Python image as a base image
FROM python:3.9

# Set the working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy requirements.txt to the container
COPY requirements.txt .

# Install pip and create a virtual environment
RUN python -m venv venv \
    && . venv/bin/activate \
    && pip install --upgrade pip \
    && pip install -r requirements.txt

# Copy the rest of the application code to the container
COPY . .

# Expose the port that the Flask app will run on
EXPOSE 5000

# Activate the virtual environment and run the Flask app
CMD ["venv/bin/python", "app.py"]

# Explanation:
# FROM python:3.9: This pulls the official Python 3.9 image as the base image.

# WORKDIR /app: Sets the working directory inside the container to /app.

# COPY requirements.txt .: Copies the requirements.txt file (which should list all the required Python packages for your Flask app) into the container.

# RUN python -m venv venv: Creates a virtual environment called venv.

# RUN . venv/bin/activate && pip install -r requirements.txt: This command activates the virtual environment and installs the dependencies listed in requirements.txt.

# COPY . .: Copies the rest of your Flask application code into the container.

# EXPOSE 5000: Exposes port 5000, which is the default port for Flask applications.

# CMD ["venv/bin/python", "app.py"]: Runs your Flask app (app.py) using the Python interpreter from the virtual environment.

# Additional Notes:
# Ensure you have a requirements.txt file in the root of your project with Flask listed (and any other dependencies), for example:

# txt
# Copy
# Flask==2.0.1
# Ensure your app.py contains the Flask app definition, for example:

# python
# Copy
# from flask import Flask
# app = Flask(__name__)

# @app.route('/')
# def hello_world():
#     return 'Hello, World!'

# if __name__ == '__main__':
#     app.run(debug=True, host='0.0.0.0')
# To build and run the Docker image:
# Save the Dockerfile in the root directory of your Flask app.

# Build the Docker image:

# bash
# Copy
# docker build -t flask-app .
# Run the Docker container:

# bash
# Copy
# docker run -p 5000:5000 flask-app
# Your Flask app will now be accessible on port 5000 of your machine.
